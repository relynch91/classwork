// Write a recursive function `stringIncludeKey(string, key)` that takes in 
// a string to search and a key string. Return true if the string contains all 
// of the characters in the key in the same order that they appear in the key.
//
// stringIncludeKey("cadbpc", "abc") => true
// stringIncludeKey("cba", "abc") => false


// Write a recursive function `recSum(numArr)` that returns the sum of all
// elements in an array. Assume all elements are numbers.

// Write a recursive function, `factorialsRec(num)`, that returns the first 
// `num` factorial numbers. Note that the 1st factorial number is 0!, which 
// equals 1. The 2nd factorial is 1!, the 3rd factorial is 2!, etc.

// Write a function `firstEvenNumbersSum(n)` that returns the sum of the
// first n even numbers recursively. Assume n > 0

// Write a function, `deepDup(arr)`, that will perform a "deep" duplication of
// the array and any interior arrays. A deep duplication means that the array 
// itself, as well as any nested arrays (no matter how deeply nested) are duped 
// and are completely different objects in memory than those in the original 
// array.

// Write a function, `fibsSum(n)`, that finds the sum of the first n
// fibonacci numbers recursively. Assume n > 0.
// Note that for this problem, the fibonacci sequence starts with [1, 1]. 

// Write a function, `digitalRoot(num)`. It should sum the digits of a positive
// integer. If the result is greater than 9 (i.e. more than one digit), sum the 
// digits of the resulting number. Keep repeating until there is only one digit 
// in the result, called the "digital root". 
// **Do not use string conversion within your method.** 
// For further explanation on the digital root concept, refer here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root
//
// You may wish to use a helper function, `digitalRootStep(num)` which performs
// one step of the process.

// Write a function, `exponent(b, n)`, that calculates b^n recursively. 
// Your solution should accept negative values for n. Do NOT use ** or Math.pow
